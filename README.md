## Why build another msging app

when i was hangging out with a friend helping him with web dev stuff, he wanted to build a msging app but he just started programming, i told him with enought practice he can build it, its easy then i thought why dont i build a msging app, well here we are

## why the private backend 
i dont trust in my self to make a "secure" app

## notes
* not tested in other devices, may break
